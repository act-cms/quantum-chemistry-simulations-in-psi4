    "Computational chemistry plays a crucial role in modern chemistry, serving as a bridge between theoretical concepts and experimental observations. For students studying physical chemistry, familiarity with computational methods is essential, as these tools allow chemists to simulate complex molecular interactions, predict reaction outcomes, visualize chemical processes at an atomic level, and back up experimental results. By leveraging computational techniques, researchers can explore systems that may be difficult or impossible to study experimentally, thus enhancing our understanding of chemical phenomena and accelerating the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals. \n",

The examples in this worksheet will serve as an introduction to the utility of electronic structure theory in predicting the properties of small molecules, and I hope you will develop a deeper appreciation for the value of electronic structure methods in aiding experimental chemists.

Although we use the Psi4 electronic structure package in this notebook, there are many others (e.g. GAMESS, Q-Chem, Columbus, Gaussian, PySCF, ORCA etc.); each of these packages has its own strengths and challenges, and which one you use will depend on the specific problem you wish to solve.

    "As you may already anticipate, just computing $E_{\\rm el}$ itself by solving electronic Schrödinger equation in Eq. (1.6) is already of significant practical use. For example, the electronic energy of a molecule at different geometries allows the prediction of the relative energies of isomers. Similarly, one can use energies to predict the lowest-energy equilibrium geometry of molecules or to determine barrier heights and energy changes for chemical reactions. Furthermore, based on the first postulate of quantum mechanics, the electronic wave function allows us to predict any molecular property. These properties include electron densities, electronic dipole (and higher-order) moments, and NMR shielding constants. Lastly, knowing electronic energies and wave functions can collectively be used to predict the UV-Vis spectra of atoms and molecules. Although these properties are of significant practical utility, solving the electronic Schrödinger equation is still an extremely challenging task, and several approximate methods have been developed over the years. \n",

    "As with any model, the accuracy of electronic structure theory calculations is determined by the underlying approximations. Apart from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, there are two approximations (loosely/broadly speaking) one usually makes in practical applications. The first approximation has to do with the choice of a **basis set** and how we describe the spatial distribution of individual electrons in the molecule. In other words, how accurate is our description of the molecular orbitals in terms of the atomic orbitals? The second approximation concerns our model for the interaction (repulsion) between electrons and is often referred to as **electron correlation** treatment. Ideally, we would use a very large and flexible basis set with a very accurate electron correlation treatment, but this is rarely practical as the computational time and resources needed for electronic structure calculations increase very quickly with basis set size and the level of correlation treatment (see figure below).\n",

    "A minimal basis set usually yields results that are *only qualitatively* correct, and we need to consider basis sets with more flexibility if we want to use electronic structure calculations *quantitatively*. For this reason, a plethora of extended basis sets have been developed over the years including split-valence basis sets, Pople-style basis sets, Karlsruhe basis sets, atomic natural orbital basis sets, and correlation-consistent basis sets. In this worksheet, we will focus on the correlation-consistent basis sets developed by Dunning and co-workers.\n",

    "What makes Eq. (1.5) difficult to solve is the electron-electron repulsion term in Eq. (1.4); if it wasn't for this term, the electronic Schrödinger equation would have been solved with a very high degree accuracy many years ago. Below, we will discuss three *ab initio* approximations for modeling the repulsion between electrons. An *ab initio* (also called first principles) method is one that only uses fundamental physical constants (e.g. fundamental unit of charge, etc.) and physical laws (e.g. postulates of quantum mechanics) without resorting to the use of experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <center> **Hartree Fock theory** </center> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of *ab initio* electronic structure approach is called the Hartree-Fock (HF) method, in which the electronic structure of a molecule is described by a single electron configuration where electrons occupy the lowest-energy orbitals, and the ground-state energy is then obtained by varying the MO expansion coefficients $\\{c_{\\alpha,i}\\}$ in Eq. (2.1). The single electron configuration approximation is equivalent to assuming that an electron moves in the average electric field generated by the remaining $N_e-1$ electrons, where $N_e$ is the total number of electrons in the molecule. The main steps of computing the orbital expansion coefficients can be summarized as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Guess the form of the molecular orbitals.\n",
    "2) Given the orbitals, construct the approximate Hamiltonian (called the Fock operator) matrix which incorporates the kinetic energy of the electrons, the nucleus-electron attractions, and the average electron-electron repulsion.\n",
    "3) Diagonalize the Fock matrix to obtain orbital energies (the eigenvalues) and orbital expansion coefficients (the eigenvectors).\n",
    "4) Because the Fock matrix depends on the orbitals, steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the total energy and electron density converge below user-defined thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the HF approximation neglects the instantaneous repulsion between electrons, the HF energy $E_{HF}$ is *above* the exact energy of the molecule. No matter how large a basis set one uses, $E_{HF} > E_{exact}$. Furthermore, also note that because most calculations use extended basis sets, the total number of MOs (denoted $N$) is greater than the number of electrons. Assuming that the molecule contains and even number of electrons, the $N_o = N_e/2$ lowest-energy MOs are doubly occupied whereas the remaining $N_v = N - N_e / 2$ MOs are unoccupied. The unoccupied MOs are sometimes referred to as virtual or external MOs. These virtual MOs may appear to be somewhat wasteful, however, their energies can be used to approximate electron affinities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <center> **Excited configurations and electron correlation** </center> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, the virtual MOs can be used by more sophisticated methods to provide a quantitatively more accurate model for electron correlation. These methods are often referred to as *correlated methods* since they aim to model the effects of electron correlation by including excited configurations obtained from the lowest-energy HF configuration. To qualitatively appreciate why these configurations might result in a lower energy than $E_{HF}$, consider a minimal basis calculation for molecular hydrogen. HF theory yields two MOs (see Eq. (2.2)) with the bonding $\\sigma_g$ MO doubly-occupied in the $\\sigma_g^2$ lowest-energy configuration. For symmetry reasons, the only other configuration that needs to be considered is the one where the antibonding $\\sigma_u$ MO is doubly occupied. At first, it may appear that this doubly-excited configuration (relative to HF) may raise the energy (since a higher-energy MO is doubly occupied), however, because the antibonding MO enhances electron density away from the internuclear region, including the $\\sigma_u^2$ configuration increases the separation between electrons and hence lowers the energy!\n",

As you may anticipate, the number of configurations included in Eq. (2.3) grows rather quickly with the number of unoccupied orbitals and the excitation level!

    "The key assumption of Møller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory is that in most cases, the effects of electron correlation are rather small. Thus, one can use perturbation theory to estimate the coefficients of excited configurations; for example, the coefficients of doubly-excited configurations are inversely proportional to the energy difference between the HF and doubly-excited configurations. This is both the strength of the method as well as its Achilles heel; the calculations are relatively quick and do not require huge computing power as evaluating the energy differences is rather easy, however, MP perturbation theory can give egregious results when configurations become degenerate (as is often the case for transition metal complexes or for molecules far from their equilibrium geometries). Nonetheless, in the absence of such degeneracies, energies from second-order (denoted MP2) and fourth-order (denoted MP4) MP perturbation theory are readily available for relatively large molecules. As well, because of the simplicity of the mathematical expressions, the derivatives needed for geometry optimization and calculating molecular properties can be evaluated efficiently.\n",

    "<br> <center> **Configuration interaction** </center> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration interaction (CI) method can be classified according to the maximum excitation level included in the CI wave function. If we include the HF configuration and the singly-excited configurations, we obtain the CI method with single excitations (CIS for short) that can be used to model excited states of molecules. Including singly- and doubly-excited configurations yields the CI method with single and double excitations (CISD) which can be used to incorporate correlation effects with a high level of accuracy. If all excitations are included, we obtain the full-CI method which represents the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation within the chosen AO basis set. The coefficients for excited configurations are determined using the linear variation method using iterative diagonalization methods that avoid the explicit construction of the Hamiltonian matrix. However, due to the iterative nature of the diagonalization, CI calculations are considerably more costly (both in terms of time and computing resources) than MP perturbation theory. Furthermore, except for full-CI, truncated CI methods such as CIS and CISD are not size-extensive and their accuracy degrades for larger molecules. Thus, CIS and CISD methods are usually used for medium-sized molecules in medium-sized basis sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <center> **Coupled cluster theory** </center> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Coupled cluster (CC) theory is considered by many as the gold standard of electronic structure theory. As in CI, there exists a hierarchy of CC approximations; for example, CCSD includes single and double excitations. If we want to further improve the accuracy without incurring too great a cost penalty, the CCSD(T) method includes (perturbatively) the effect of triple excitations and provides highly accurate energies and molecular properties. However, notice that because triple excitations are included using perturbation theory, CCSD(T) can also provide nonphysical results when degeneracies occur. Although the CI and CC methods may appear similar on the surface, they are quite distinct. Because CC theory uses an exponential parameterization of the excitation operator, the CC wave function is more accurate since higher-order excited configurations are included indirectly (i.e. coefficients for quadruply excited configurations are expressed as products of coefficients of doubly- and/or singly- excited configurations). Furthermore, because the CC method is size-extensive, its accuracy does not degrade for larger molecules. Taken together, in the absence of degeneracies, *CCSD(T) represents the gold standard in quantum chemistry that is applicable to medium-sized molecules with medium-sized basis sets*.     "
